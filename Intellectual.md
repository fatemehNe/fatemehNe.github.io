### Team Work
#### ELCH Hackathon
Recently, I participated in the ELCH hackathon where I got into finals with my teammate(Nour), and we will present at CISO Forum on Jan 31st! I registered in this hackathon by myself, but then learned that I can team up with other participants, so I talked to one of the participants and teamed up! The point is that I have never met Nour and did not know each other, yet we managed to cooperate over zoom and did a great job that resulted in being selected as finalists! In this hackathon, we wrote an incident response report for a hypothetical office breach.
I will update the results here!

### Fast learner
#### Graduating from master's in only a year and 4 months!
I started my master's in cyber security with a background in computer hardware, a completely different field in computer science. Not only does starting a new field and trying to learn about that field take quite a long time, but also conducting research and making it work is a slow process and even more time-consuming than simply learning! well, I could proudly do both in a year and 4 months instead of 2 years.

### Love challenges
#### Every time I learned a new thing!
Unlike most people, I love challenges! Challenges are like boosters to my motives and make keep going forward! Without challenges task will become boring for me after several month, but challenges gives a reason to go beyond my knowledge and learn the solution for the challenge and improve myself.

### Eager to learn
#### starting from computer hardware and landing in cyber security!
Beside the joy of overcoming challenges, I love expanding my knowledge. During my highschool I was part of the robotic team. Then later in my bachelor's, although my focus was on computer hardware I worked as a full stack developer for my first internship. In my second internship I did research in hardware security field. As my bachelor's dissertation project I implemented LSTM neural network on FPGA boards which was totally new for me. Last but not least, I did my master's in cyber security and I am exploring the field so far by working different areas such as malware analysis and incident response.
